Hey guyss!
This is one of the solutions I made to one of the Frontend Mentor Challenges (You should check it out if you haven't) @(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)
I used CSS Grid and Flexbox for the layouts 
I chose this challenge because of the UI and I enjoyed every moment I spent on this code
I aspire to solve even more challenges!
